// Faith goes to Level 2, open electric door, find Vince in Room 235
Vince - I know you can do it, Faith!
Faith - Stop lying to me!
Vince - What are you talking about?
Faith - I've been in Test Subject 736's memory, I know you've manipulating her
to kill everyone! What exactly are you up to?
Vince - Faith, I need you to calm down. I know it's hard to believe, but things
weren't as it seems. Trust me, I'm your ONLY friend.
Faith - What kind of friend would keep secret from each other??
Vince - Please Faith, everything I've done is for your own good.
Faith - Sure, if you aren't telling me the truth, I guess I'm gonna figure it
out on my own!
Vince - No Faith! Don't do that! NOOO...
