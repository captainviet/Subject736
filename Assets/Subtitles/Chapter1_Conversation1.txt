// Faith goes into Security's memory, whom was sitting in the Security Control
room, checking camera console
Security - "What on Earth is going on?"
// Security checked the camera console to discover many bodies lying on the
floor
Security - "MAH GOSH!! Looks like they need help!! I must go up there!!"
Guide - Go upstairs to help the unconscious people.
// Click the control table, select button
Security - "That's the alarm control for each floor. I don't think that's
necessary for now..."
// Security encountered Test Subject 736 as he exits his room, killed by her
and returns control to Faith
Faith - "Poor guy, didn't even know what's going on..."
